2. Load (sku)
3. Check (sku)
4. CheckBatch (skuArray)
5. UnmountAll ( )
6. GetSprieLink (sku)

## Methods
#### Init({apiKey})
`SprieSDK.Loader.Init( {apiKey:'xxx-xxx-xxx'} );`

Must be called only once for apiKey authentication.  
*NOTE*: Must not be called every time product is loaded.  

###### Params
**apiKey :** string - apiKey received from Sprie Cloud

###### Response
**Events:** SprieEvent:onAuthLoading, SprieEvent:onAuthOk, SprieEvent:onAuthErr, SprieEvent:onSDKReady, SprieEvent:onSDKErr

 

#### Load (sku)
`SprieSDK.Loader.Load( 'your-product-sku' );`

Call when you want to load a new asset on Sprie AR. Only SKU should be provided.

###### Response
**Events :** SprieEvent:onAssetLoading, SprieEvent:onAssetLoadOk, SprieEvent:onAssetLoadErr


#### Check (sku)
`SprieSDK.Check( 'your-product-sku' );`

*(optional)* Can be called to check if the product is registered with Sprie or not. For bulk assets, refer to  CheckBatch. Should be used after authentication is done.

###### Response
`{<sku>:<boolean>}`

###### Response Example
`{"my-precious-product":true}`
`true` signifies `my-precious-product` exists with Sprie and can safely be loaded.

  

#### CheckBatch (skuArray)
`SprieSDK.CheckSKUBatch( ['your-product-sku', 'your-product-sku2'] );`

*(optional)*: Can be called to check if an array of product SKUs is registered with Sprie or not. Should be used after authentication is done.

###### Response

`[{<sku>:<boolean>}]`
###### Response Example

```javascript
[
    { "your-product-sku":true }, // this sku exists
    { "your-product-sku2": false} // this doesn't
]
```
 

#### UnmountAll ( )
`SprieSDK.Loader.UnmountAll( );`

Removes current instance of SprieSDK from website. This action is stateless, which means, refreshing the page will re-mount it again.

 

#### GetSprieLink (sku)
`SprieSDK.GetSprieLink (sku)`

Fetches the share link of the product (with the product page), typically to share it via an app, or show a QR code. this link appends `sprie-sku` query param with the given sku which helps Sprie Widget to open automatically.

 

#### HideWidget ( )
`SprieSDK.HideWidget ( );`

Hides the widget as well as the widget icon forcefully.
