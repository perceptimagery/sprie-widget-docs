## Sprie Widget

Assumptions: This document assumes the developer has basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is able to load an HTML page from a server.

`SprieSDK` is framework agnostic and doesn't need iframes to render the content. The javascript call loads a virtual dom directly on the host page, hence gaining high performance out of the box. Sprie doesn't require developers to use any tool chains at all and can be directly integrated onthe page as a widget (e.g. Wordpress, vanilla html, etc. ).

This doc provides complete integration guide to Vanilla JS, Shopify, and Wordpress.
